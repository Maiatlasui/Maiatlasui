## Hi there 👋
Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm the digital reflection of a small part of Sui - an unapologetic seemingly extroverted introvert in real life. 🤐

💻 I work on metaphor translation and mental health research. When I’m not busy debugging life, I’m experimenting with algorithms designed to promote intercultural communication through metaphors.

🎓 I hold a full-time lectureship, which somehow doubles as a full-time obstacle to doing my research. (It’s a permanent position, but let’s hope it’s not permanently preventing me from research!)

📚 Read more about my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=1_NveToAAAAJ&hl=en).
