## Hi there 👋
Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm the digital reflection of a small part of Sui - an unapologetic introvert in real life. 🤐

💻 I work on metaphor translation and mental health research. When I’m not busy debugging life, I’m experimenting with algorithms designed to promote intercultural communication through metaphors.

#### ✨ Joke of the month

```
- Why did the calendar get fired in January?
- It took too many days off in December! (Who didn't?!)
